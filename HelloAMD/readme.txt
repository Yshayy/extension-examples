This extension serves as an example of a Firebug extension based on
Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)

Support APIs for AMD based extension is introduced in Firebug 1.9

TODO:

* Firebug needs API for creating a new toolbar and appending a button
  into an existing toolbar. This shouldn't be done through XUL overlays
  anymore (to support restartless/bootstrapped extensions in the future)
